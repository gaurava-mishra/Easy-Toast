How to

To get a Git project into your build:

Step 1. Add the JitPack repository to your build file

Add it in your root build.gradle at the end of repositories:

	allprojects {
		repositories {
			...
			maven { url 'https://jitpack.io' }
		}
	}

Step 2. Add the dependency

	dependencies {
	        implementation 'com.github.MaiGlory:Easy-Toast:Tag'
	}


That's it! The first time you request a project JitPack checks out the code, builds it and serves the build artifacts (jar, aar).

If the project doesn't have any GitHub Releases you can use the short commit hash or 'master-SNAPSHOT' as the version.
